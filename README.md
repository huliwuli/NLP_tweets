The COVID-19 pandemic has altered daily life with a myriad of consequences for people’s health and mental health. Vaccinations rollouts across many countries have been perceived both positively and negatively by the media and had a potential impact on individuals’ attitudes and beliefs. In this project, we use Twitter data to examine associations between people’s attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines and assess topics discussed. 
We implemented regression analyses to examine how positive, neutral, and negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines changed over time.  Results indicate that global attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines significantly shifted from negative to positive over the past 12 months (p <0.05). In addition to using Vader scores to classify sentiments we also performed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model topics represented. Finally, we implemented emotion classification to classify our texts. We achieved a high accuracy of 83% in lightgbm, and a higher accuracy of 92.17% in LSTM model after dealing with data imbalance. We discuss these findings and their implications for understanding global attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations.
